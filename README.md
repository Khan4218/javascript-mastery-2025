# JavaScript Mastery 2025

This repository documents my journey to mastering JavaScript in 2025.  
I'm revisiting JavaScript fundamentals through the Scrimba course to build a deeper understanding of the language before moving into backend development with Node.js.

## 🔥 Why This Repo?

I'm focused on writing clean, modular code while reinforcing core JavaScript concepts like:

- ✅ Variables & Data Types
- ✅ Functions & Scope
- ✅ Arrays & Objects
- ✅ DOM Manipulation
- ✅ Events & Forms
- ✅ ES6+ Features
- ✅ Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- ✅ Error Handling & Debugging

## 📚 Source of Learning

- 🧠 [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M)
- 📖 Additional practice from MDN, LeetCode, and small project challenges

## 📁 Folder Structure
/projects           → Mini projects (Todo App, Weather App, Quiz Game)
/notes              → Topic-wise JS notes
/challenges         → Practice questions & coding challenges
README.md

## 🧪 Goal

To become highly confident in vanilla JavaScript and build a strong foundation for moving into **Node.js** and full-stack development.

# Passenger Counter App

This project is part of my advanced JavaScript mastery journey. Although I've already built modern web apps with React and TypeScript, I'm revisiting core JavaScript fundamentals to strengthen my foundation.

🔗 Live Demo: [akba-passenger-counter-app.netlify.app](https://akba-passenger-counter-app.netlify.app)

## 💡 Purpose

Even small projects like this one reinforce key DOM concepts like:

- `document.getElementById`
- `innerText` manipulation
- Event listeners and click handling

## 🧠 What's Different This Time

- Writing clean, modular code
- Naming variables meaningfully
- Focusing on reusability and clarity
- Practicing Git commits with intention

## 🚀 Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
