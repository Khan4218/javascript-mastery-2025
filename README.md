# JavaScript Mastery 2025

This repository documents my journey to mastering JavaScript in 2025.  
I'm revisiting JavaScript fundamentals through the Scrimba course to build a deeper understanding of the language before moving into backend development with Node.js.

## 🔥 Why This Repo?

I'm focused on writing clean, modular code while reinforcing core JavaScript concepts like:

- ✅ Variables & Data Types
- ✅ Functions & Scope
- ✅ Arrays & Objects
- ✅ DOM Manipulation
- ✅ Events & Forms
- ✅ ES6+ Features
- ✅ Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- ✅ Error Handling & Debugging

## 📚 Source of Learning

- 🧠 [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M)
- 📖 Additional practice from MDN, LeetCode, and small project challenges

## 📁 Folder Structure
/projects           → Mini projects (Todo App, Weather App, Quiz Game)
/notes              → Topic-wise JS notes
/challenges         → Practice questions & coding challenges
README.md

## 🧪 Goal

To become highly confident in vanilla JavaScript and build a strong foundation for moving into **Node.js** and full-stack development.

## 💡 Purpose

Even small projects like this one reinforce key DOM concepts like:

- `document.getElementById`
- `innerText` manipulation
- Event listeners and click handling

## 🧠 What's Different This Time

- Writing clean, modular code
- Naming variables meaningfully
- Focusing on reusability and clarity
- Practicing Git commits with intention

## 🚀 Built With
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
